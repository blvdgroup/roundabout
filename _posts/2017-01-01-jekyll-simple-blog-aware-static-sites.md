Jekyll is an awesome static-site generator that you can use to create your own website in minutes. From Jekyll's docs:

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) and our [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers **for free**.
