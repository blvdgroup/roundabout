Roundabout is a minimalist & customisable theme for Jekyll. It attempts to be as lean and lightweight as possible, whilst maintaining mobile-first principles, as well as other best practices in the modern web.

By using the Roundabout theme, you'll get:

* A complete setup including sample layouts, config, a Atom feed and some example posts/pages.
* A modern design utilising semantic HTML5 elements and compiled + minified SCSS stylesheets.
* Syntax highlighting with Jekyll's default highlighter, Rouge.
* An extremely customisable and extensible base for developing a full-fledged Jekyll website.
